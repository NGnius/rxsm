## FAQ

> **I don't see any saves when I start RXSM, how do I fix it?**

*There should be a prompt on startup so you can fix this. If you need more information or it doesn't show up, [go here](https://github.com/NGnius/rxsm/wiki/User-Guide#configuration).*

> **How do I use RXSM?**

*You click things. I understand RXSM seems like its a millions of years old, but I expect you know that much. For an overview of what all the clickable things do, check out the [user guide](https://github.com/NGnius/rxsm/wiki/User-Guide#usage).*

> **Where can I report bugs?**

*The best place is by creating an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/NGnius/rxsm/issues), but talking to NGnius on Discord also works.*

> **How can I help out?**

*Show it to your friends, your mother or even some long-dead fossil creature! [Bug reports](https://github.com/NGnius/rxsm/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/NGnius/rxsm/pulls) also help.*

> **What's with all the bad dinosaur puns?**

*First off all bad? They're t-rex-ible (terrible). The reason? RXSM is pronounced rexism, as in T-rex-ism.*
